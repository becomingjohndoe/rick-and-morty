              Lick, lick, lick my balls! its fine, everythings is fine. theres an infinite number of realities Morty, 
              and in a few dozens of those i got lucky and turned everything back to normal. 
              Is he keeping his shoulders square? Oooooooh he's tryin'! I'll tell you how I feel about school, Jerry. 
              It's a waste of time. Bunch of people runnin' around bumpin' into each other, got a guy up front says, 
              '2 + 2,' and the people in the back say, '4.' Then the bell rings and they give you a carton of milk 
              and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or somethin'. I mean, it's not a place for smart 
              people, Jerry. I know that's not a popular opinion, but that's my two cents on the issue.
